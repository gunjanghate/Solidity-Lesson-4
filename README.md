# Solidity Lesson 4 â€“ Fund Me Project  

This repository contains Solidity code and smart contract implementations I worked on while learning from **Patrick Collins' Solidity course**, specifically focusing on **funding mechanisms and smart contract security**. The implementation is inspired by the [Cyfrin Remix Fund Me](https://github.com/Cyfrin/remix-fund-me-cu) project.
